## To Run
To run you will need [processing](https://processing.org). This code has been tested on Linux. There are likely to be problems if you run this on a mac (this is an issue with processing itself).
## How to Play
### Controls
WASD – Move in all directions Move Mouse – Aim
Left Mouse – Shoot
Right Mouse – Gravity Generator
### Gravity Power
Gravity will make your ship invincible and attract enemies towards you. It can be used for five seconds but you must wait five seconds before it begins to recharge. The gravity generator can only be activated if you have 50% power.
### Enemies
Enemies will spawn from the blue portals. A new wave will spawn every ten seconds or if there are no enemies left.
#### Seeker
The seeker is much like the player ship. It will continually move towards you.
#### Shooter
The shooter will also move towards you while also shooting at you.
#### Wanderer
The wanderer will not target you but it will send out bullets in a fan shape.
### Multiplier
The multiplier will increase every time you kill an enemy. If you die, or fail to kill an enemy after five seconds, your multiplier resets to one. Kill enemies fast to increase your multiplier and your score!
### Game Over
The game ends once you have run out of lives.
